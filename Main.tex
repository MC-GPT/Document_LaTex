\begin{abstract}
Our team is focusing on providing an application service for making up the mood of parties that are hosted at homes and shared spaces. We plan developing lighting \& appliance control, multiplayer games and space management functions, available to all participants for an entertaining party.\\
We came up with the idea “MC GPT” as we thought of a solution that could release the burden of party hosts and make the party more memorable. Party hosts have many factors to consider such as the lighting of the space, temperature, contents of the party, music and many others. To reduce these tasks focused on the host, our team developed three main functions.\\
First, “MC GPT” has the function to register and control various appliances at any place. For example, lighting devices can be adjusted in color and brightness; other appliances can be adjusted accordingly, such as temperature control of air conditioners. Moreover, we use generative AI to suggest and change the color and brightness of lights according to user inputs.\\
Another function is providing multiplayer mini-games that can be enjoyed with mobile devices of participants. Playing the game involves one game host and other participants. The host can see the questions along with answers of the games, answering orders of participants and moving on to the next games. Participants can view questions of the games and are also provided with an answering button that checks order based on the speed of pressing the button.\\
Finally, space owners can control their spaces by using a unique code generated by the application. These codes can be distributed to other participants which allows them to gain access to all the appliances and games. Importantly, the code can be refreshed which prohibits access from outdated codes.\\
In conclusion, our team hopes to provide appliance control along with a game function that will reduce the tasks required by party hosts, resulting in a more seamless party and help all participants leave with a memorable party experience.

\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Motivation and Term Definition}
        n house parties and Korean ‘MT’s, where many college students and young adults go to have fun these days, the ‘Host’ can  have a hard time controlling the party and provide various recreational content. If the Host was someone other than a human or aided by an app or software, it can ultimately lead to a better party experience. Also everyone could join the party instead of being divided into host and participants, because the host can choose from various functions to lessen the burden of party preparation.\\
    	For a fun MT and house party, not only party games but also setting the party mood is one of the most important things. To do so, our team figured it could be done by providing lighting \& appliance control, mini-games and space control.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item MT : Membership Training in Korea - A party lasts roughly two days and is considered a free-form training session, where students spend time socializing with peers in the same majors or student clubs, often at a remote location.
            \item MC : a Korean phrase used to refer to the official host of the ceremonies, parties, events, or similar performances.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Problem Statements}
        There are a number of issues that arise when hosting parties and games. Running out of game ideas, not enough people to conduct the games, the wrong situation for the party, and more. We will provide a service that will make it simpler for party hosts to manage their party.
        \subsubsection{Why House Parties are Trending}
        
        Home parties have gained popularity in South Korea, especially among the younger generation, for several reasons
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Influence of Social Media: The development of social media platforms made it easier to archive and share special moments. House parties are desired moments worth sharing among many social media users, which resulted in the increase of hosting house parties.
            \item Cost-Effective: House parties are a more budget-friendly option compared to expensive dining or clubbing. Due to recent inflation of the economy, the number of people dining out has decreased significantly. Therefore, sharing simple food and drinks with friends has become a economical option.
            \item Feels Like Home: House parties provide a comfortable and convenient setting to spend time with friends and family, usually following with meaningful interactions and conversations.
            \item Diversity of Activities: House parties offer a range of activities beyond food and drinks, including board games, karaoke, movie nights, dancing, and mini-games.
            \item Cultural Influence: here is a growing interest in Western culture in South Korea, and the concept of house parties from the west may have contributed to their popularity.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \subsubsection{Role of the Party Host}
        As a party host, you need to be in charge of the mood, and you want to keep things interesting and preventing participants from getting bored. Most of all, you want to make sure your guests have a good time.\\
        There are a number of issues that arise when hosting parties and games. Running out of game ideas, not enough people to run the games, the wrong atmosphere for the party and others.\\
        The main role of a house party host is to help guests have a good time and keep the party seamless, but they can't fully enjoy the party with other things to worry about.

    \subsection{Solution}
        We will provide a service that will make it simpler for party hosts to manage their appliances during parties. It will be controlled by using generative AI and providing suggestions.\\
        These days, there are appliances for home parties, but we wanted a way to integrate with smart home systems and devices to make it easy to control multiple devices from one app.\\
        We want to provide  mini-games that require no preparation and is accessible to everyone. We don't want the host to feel stressed about preparing, but rather provide a time for everyone to have fun during the party.

    \subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}
        \subsubsection{Ten-Ten arcade}
            'Ten-Ten' is a multiplayer battle game designed for accessible and enjoyable gaming experiences. The software stands out with its simplicity, allowing users to swiftly create and join game rooms through barcode scanning.\\
            Notable features include real-time multiplayer connectivity, making it ideal for social settings like college events and company orientations. The game offers a diverse range of options, from smartphone-based games to simultaneous multiplayer experiences, catering to varied preferences.\\
            The software's competitive edge lies in its robust ranking and statistics system. Displaying top 100 rankings for each game, it fosters competition and motivates players to challenge themselves. Additionally, the visualization of player activity provides a quick overview of their engagement.\\
            It offers a user-friendly and socially connected multiplayer gaming platform with diverse game options and a compelling ranking system. Its simplicity and versatility make it suitable for various social gatherings and events.
    \section{Requirement Analysis}
    
    \subsection{Logging In}
    Logging in is required for users to have access to functions of the application. Without a login, it is impossible to use any of the functions of the app. If the application is not logged in, users can create their own account or login using an account they have created before. 
    
    \subsection{Creating Account}
    Users can sign up by setting a user id and password of their preference. Signing in requires input  of the given information in the sign up process such as userid, password and name.
    
    \subsection{Space Management}
    “Space” refers to any type of place where parties can be held and added to the software. Space management mainly focuses on space creation and space connection. Space creation means making a new space so that it can be used to link with electronics and made available for others to join. Space connection means gaining access to spaces via the code provided by owners. Each space has a unique code which can be shared with others and is required to access the functions provided. The code can be generated by creating a space in the application and request code generation on the settings tab. Also, Space management is separated into 2 types of classes;owners and users.\\ \\
    Space owner: Can generate random authentication codes for individual spaces. Also, it is possible to refresh the code which terminates the validity of the code for previous users, forcing them to lose access of the space.\\ \\
    Space user: A space user can gain access to spaces with the code provided by the owner. By having the code, the user also has access to the lighting and appliances pre-registered by the Space owner.

    \subsection{Status Dashboard}
    Users can view the status of the space upon logging into the software. It is the first page that a user will encounter upon connecting to a space. The dashboard acts as the main page of the application. It includes the name of the space, a simple announcement bar, data on space temperature and air quality. The name of the space is provided by owners, space temperature and air quality information comes from data on the related appliance. Also, it contains a music player where all users with access can add desired songs to a shared playlist. It is connected to whatever music output device that is present at the space, which means controlling the music player will have an effect on the sound of the space for everyone. 

    \subsection{Lighting Control}
    Provides controlling any hardware with lighting function. Users can change the brightness, color and effects of the lights using the software. It is not just for lighting devices but also for any kind of appliance that has a lighting function such as a NUGU candle or LG Mood-Up refrigerator Also, users can input any type of situation desired in natural language and the lighting will automatically change accordingly using AI. The input can be made by a input box using a keyboard or by requesting it in speech to an AI speaker. To help users that cannot make a decision for which lighting to use, there will be some preset requests available to execute.

    \subsection{Appliance Control}
    Provides control of any appliances that are synced with the software, such as changing the space temperature using an air conditioner, checking remaining beer amount on Homebrew,  setting the power of a air purifier. It will be functioning as a shared setting, which means any user can adjust the appliance. This will help make the environment of the party adequete for party instantly. Also, space owners can lock certain appliances, which results in prohibiting users from access to the locked appliance. Locking option can be activated by toggling a lock icon inside the appliance settings

    \subsection{Party Games}
    Users can play games from a list of games provided. There are 2 types of users in the process of the game, operator and participant. \\
    
    Game operator: Page consist of the answer of the game, a list to check the answering order, buttons for moving on to the next game and quitting the game for everyone\\
    
    Game participant: Page consist of the game question and a push button for confirming the answering order, which is in first-come-first-served basis.\\
    
    Currently there will be 3 games that will be serviced, however it is possible to include various games since the format is shared. The list of serviced games are as following.\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Image game: An AI model merges the face of two celebrities, the participants are asked to guess the celebrities based on the merged image.
        \item Landmark guessing game: The game receives the coordinates of famous landmarks around the world from OpenAI API. The data is sent to Google map API for a street view photo of the coordinate. Participants are required to guess the landmark from the street view photo.
        \item Gather up: Game operator first inputs the number of participants. NUGU speaker plays any music for about 10 seconds, stop the music and tell how many people to gather up. Then, participants gather up according to the given number and participants who could not gather up are eliminated. The process will be entirely conducted by the NUGU speaker, and the given number will be calculated by a pre-set algorithm
    \end{itemize}

\section{Specification}
    \subsection{Loading Page}
        When a application communicates with servers, a delay is inevitable in the process. During the delay, it might show just a blank screen to users. To prevent users from getting a blank page, a loading screen will appear instead. This applies to all functions that require server communication including login, register, space creation, space connection and etc. \\
        This loading page UI is made by ‘skeleton’ from React Native. While receiving data from the server, components without received data shows that it is loading. In other words, while server is processing and receiving data after a http request has been made by the client. It can make a seamless and user friendly UI by using the loading screen.
    \subsection{Login Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/screen/1_Login.png}}
        \label{fig}
        \caption{Login Page}
        \end{figure}
        Logging in is required for users to have access to functions of the application. Without a login, it is impossible to use any of the functions of the app. If the application is not logged in, users can create their own account or login using an account they have created before. \\
        In a back-end point of view, The client receives an ID and password from the user and sends a request to the server when a button is pressed. On the server, it checks if there is ‘Member’ data in the DB and, if it exists, returns a security token known as JWT. The token expires after a certain time for security reasons and needs to be refreshed.  The client stores the JWT and includes it in the header of every request sent. \\
        In a front-end point of view, When a user clicks on the ID input field or the password input field, the input field's border is emphasized, and a keyboard appears. The screen moves up when the keyboard appears to ensure that it does not cover the screen.  If the user enters their ID and then presses the next button on the keyboard, it automatically transits to the password input field. The password displayed on the screen is encrypted while it is being entered.  Both the ID and password must be entered for the login button to become active. When the login button is pressed, it changes to a loading screen while the login process is executed on the server. After the login process is completed, the screen transitions to a page with a list of spaces. If the login fails, an Alert message is displayed, and the user remains on the login screen.
    \subsection{Register Page}
        \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/screen/2_Register.png}}
        \caption{Login Page}
        \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        Users can sign up by setting a user id and password of their preference. Signing in requires input  of the given information in the sign up process such as user id, password and name. There are boxes for input of the ID, name, nickname, password and password check. ID is the one that should be input in the login process, name refers to real name, nickname will be the name that will be shown to other users, password is also used in the login process and password check is used to double check if the user made their password as intended.\\
        Initially, on the client side, there are character limits and a check to ensure that the password and password check fields match. Once the client-side validation is successful, the client sends these fields to the server because client-side checks can be easily bypassed. On the server side, there is a secondary validation for each field to check for errors. If there are no errors, the data is saved to the Member database.  \\
        For the UI which is similar to the login process, clicking on an input field highlights it, brings up the keyboard, and ensures that the keyboard doesn't cover the screen. Even if the user doesn't directly click on an input field, pressing the next button will move to the next input field. The password and password confirm fields are displayed in an encrypted format. If any of the fields (name, nickname, ID, password, password confirm) are left empty or if the password and password confirm do not match, the sign-up button remains inactive. Only when all input fields are correctly filled does the sign-up button become active. Upon successful registration, the screen transits to the login page. If registration fails, an alert message is displayed, and the user remains on the registration screen.
    \subsection{Space List Page}
         \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{Images/screen/3_Space Selection.png}}
        \caption{Space List Page}
        \label{fig}
        \end{figure}
        “Space” refers to any type of place where parties can be held and these spaces can be added to the application. Page with the list of spaces is where users can outlook the spaces that are registered to the app. It is divided into two parts; first is ‘My Home ', which is the list of spaces that are owned by the user and registered to the application. Second is ‘Guest’ which has a list of spaces that the users are as guests by inputting the entrance code of spaces. Also there are buttons to activate pop-ups that allow users to add a new space or a pop-up for guest users to input the space code they have received.\\
        The JWT, sent in the header, is decoded to extract the user's ID. Using this ID, both the list of spaces owned by the member and the list of spaces the member has joined as a guest are retrieved.\\
        On the screen, the space list is displayed in two columns, with a "My Home" section and a "Guest" section, clearly distinguishing between the spaces the member owns and the spaces they have joined as a guest.  Clicking the "Create Space" button opens a pop-up screen for creating a space, and clicking the "Enter Code" button opens a pop-up screen for entering a code to join an existing space. Space owners will see their spacess listed under "My Home," while guests will see records of the spaces they have joined under the "Guest" section.  Clicking the "Log Out" button will transition the screen back to the initial login screen.
    \subsection{Space Registration Pop-Up}
        For a space to be ready to use in the application, it needs to be registered firsthand. The space registration pop-up can be accessed via the space list page. By activating the pop-up, space owners can input the name of the space and receive a invitation code for the space. After this process is valid, the new space should be added to the space list page.\\
        On the screen, the user inputs a room name, and a request is sent to the server to store it in the Home database. During this process, a room ID is generated along with a 4-digit random code that will be used for guest access. \\
        A pop-up screen for entering the space title is displayed. While this pop-up is open, the background of the room selection screen becomes opaque, and elements on the room selection screen cannot be interacted until the pop-up is closed. If the user clicks the "Back" button, they return to the space selection screen. If they enter a valid space title and click the "Confirm" button, a space is created, and the screen transitions to the Dashboard Page of the newly created space. If the space title is not entered correctly, a space creation failure alert is displayed, and the pop-up screen remains open.
    \subsection{Space Entrance Pop-Up}
        Space entrance pop-up is the first step for guest users to be able to gain allowance to spaces. This pop-up can be accessed from the space list page.  A space user can gain access to spaces with the code provided by the owner. By having the code, the user also has access to the lighting and appliances pre-registered by the Space owner. Upon inserting a valid space code, it will add a new space to the guest section of the space list page. Now users are allowed on the spaces.\\
        On the screen, when a code is entered, a request is sent to the server. The server searches the Home database for a matching entry. It also retrieves the user's ID from the JWT and fetches Member information. Once a match is found, the server stores the relationship between the Home and the Member in the Guest database, marking the user as a guest in that particular space.\\
        The process for entering a space using a code is similar to the space creation pop-up. After entering a valid code and clicking the "Confirm" button, the user enters the corresponding space, and the initial page, the Dashboard Page, is displayed. If the code is not entered correctly, an alert message is shown, prompting the user to re-enter the code, and the pop-up screen remains open.
    \subsection{Dashboard (Main Page)}
        The Dashboard page is the main page that is first shown to users when entering a space. The main function of the dashboard page is showing an overview of the ongoing party. To help this objective, users can control the music playing from an audio device connected to the application, if there is any. Also there is a shared playlist where party participants can add desired songs to the list. In addition, there are information on the status of the space such as room temperature and air quality. These data can be sourced from the appliances that are connected to the space. Finally at the top there is the name of the space, exit space button, space code and a brief announcement bar. Name and code for the space is based on the data from the database and exiting button leads users back to the space list page. For the announcement bar, any user can post up to 25 characters and all users in the space can see the announcement.\\
        It's a screen composed of tabs, and from the user's perspective, it's not ideal to send requests every time you switch tabs, as it can cause delays. Therefore, as soon as you enter this screen, all the data for the space, including lighting and appliance lists, as well as the game list, is fetched all at once. This data is stored in a context for later use.\\        
        Announcements are displayed as text animations that move from the left side of the screen to the right side, taking 1 minute. There's a button to return to the room selection screen, allowing users to navigate back. On the screen, the album cover of the music currently playing on the AI speaker is displayed, along with music playback options and playlists.
    \subsection{Lightning \& Appliance Dashboard}
        The appliance tab is the second tab of the application, which has functions that controls the appliances that are connected by the owner. The appliances are categorized into two groups: those with lighting and those without lighting. This page can give an overview of all the lighting and non-lighting appliances of the space. The dashboard consists of 2 identical pages for each type of appliance.\\
        In the Lighting tab, only appliances with the "light" variable set to true in the appliance list data are displayed.  Users can enter their desired ambiance in an input field, and based on the current number of people in the space and the ambiance input, they receive lighting RGB values and effects recommendations from a generative AI. These recommendations are then transmitted to all the lights using Matter for configuration.\\
        In the appliance tab, appliances without lighting features are able to be controlled. The specific functions vary on what type of appliances are added to the tab. It will be specified on later specifications but one example could be a temperature adjustment for an air conditioner.\\
        All appliance buttons are displayed on the screen in two columns and support simple on/off functionality. Tapping each appliance button takes the user to a detailed control screen for each individual appliance. By using the tabs at the top of the screen, users can switch to a screen for controlling appliances without lighting. "Add Lighting" or "Add Appliance" button allows users to add new appliances. Users can enter the desired lighting in an input field and, by pressing the keyboard's completion button, can obtain suitable lighting effects through OpenAI API and the server.

    \subsection{Lighting Device \& Appliance Registration Pop-Up}
        In order to control the appliances from the app, it needs to be registered initially. The registration pop-up will receive information about appliances from the owner ultimately sending the data to the server. Information needed for registration are the serial numbers and name of appliance. In an input bar on the pop-up serial numbers and names are entered. The server automatically categorizes the appliance based on the serial number, checking if it has lighting or determining its type.\\
        Tapping the serial number input field brings up the numerical keyboard, while tapping the name input field displays the Korean keyboard. The "Back" button allows users to return to the lighting screen, and after entering the information correctly, clicking the "Confirm" button results in the creation of a new lighting appliance. If the information is not entered correctly, the lighting appliance is not created, and a "Lighting(Appliance) Creation Failure" alert message is displayed.

    \subsection{Lighting Control Page}
        Using a standardized format with Matter, the frontend sends requests to the appliance in a structured format based on the input it receives.\\
        This screen allows you to control detailed lighting effects for appliances with lighting. At the top of the screen, the icon and name of the selected lighting appliance are displayed. You can control not only the on/off function of the lighting appliance but also check and modify features such as color, brightness, and usage.

    \subsection{Appliance Control Page}
        For all appliances, you have the on/off function. If it's an air conditioner, you can control temperature, fan speed, energy-saving mode, and reservation functions. If it's an air purifier, you can control fan speed, view particulate matter (PM) levels, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels. If it's a steamer, you can select courses and view the timer. For robot vacuum cleaners, you can choose cleaning modes, select strong, medium, or weak power, and enable quiet mode. Each appliance has its specific and detailed control features.
    \subsection{Game Dashboard}
        The game dashboard is the gateway to playing any of the game provided by the application. The main function is to show the list of games available and by pressing on a component of a list, it will activate the game. The details of the games such as name, the logic of the game are all coming from the server, which means that any kind of game can be added anytime on the back-end.\\
        Upon entering the main tab, the data context received is used to display the list of games on the screen. Clicking on a game in the list creates a game room (Game\_Room DB), with the first person to click becoming the game's host. Subsequently, they are connected to the host's screen. (Only one game room can be created within a space.) Clicking the "Join" button allows a user to join a game room currently in progress in the space. Subsequently, they are connected to the participant's screen. The game list received from the server is displayed in a single column on the screen.

    \subsection{Game Host Page}
        The game host page is a page for the first person to press a game on the game list. By being the first person pressing, it automatically makes them the host of the game. The host’s page consists of all information needed to run the game such as game question, game answer, go to next quiz, end game and a serial list of users based on the speed of pressing the answering button. The host can give user chances to answer according to the list of users and verify if the player has got the answer right. If the answer is correct or nobody got the answer or any situation that regards to move on, the host can press the next game button.\\
        Upon entering the screen, a WebSocket connection is established, and a request with messageType = ENTER is sent. When the "Next Question" button is pressed, the Flask server fetches the question for the selected game, sends it over WebSocket to display it for all participants, and sends a request with messageType = NEXT. When the "Reveal Answer" button is pressed, the answer to the received question is sent over WebSocket to display it for all participants, and a request with messageType = ANSWER is sent. At the bottom of the screen, the nickname of the participant at the top of the first-come, first-served list is displayed. Clicking the "Next" button removes the next person from the list.\\
        The name of the selected game is displayed in the top left corner of the screen, while the "End Game" and "Next Question" buttons are positioned in the top right corner. The game screen may vary depending on the type of game, with images displayed for games that require them and a default image for games that do not. At the bottom of the screen, a list of participants in the game, organized by arrival order, is displayed.

    \subsection{Game Participant Page}
        Game participant page is for users that are actually playing the game. The same page is displayed to all users. The main functions provided are to see what the question or quiz is, and a button that gives you the chance to answer these questions. \\
        The screen for participants is similar to the game host page but lacks the "End Game" and "Next Question" buttons. When participants press a button, they are added to the list in the order in which they respond. \\
    	Upon entering the screen, a WebSocket connection is established, and a message with messageType = ENTER is sent. When the game host displays a question, all participants automatically receive a request and see the question. Pressing the "Answer" button adds the participant to the list in the Game\_Room DB in a first-come, first-served manner.

    \subsection{AI Guessing Game}
        When the operator of the app runs the toonify AI code, the original and result photo files are stored in the problem and answer folders of AWS S3 cloud storage with ascending numerical filenames. When a user requests the AI guessing game in the app, the backend randomly selects a number, generates URLs for the number.png files in the problem and answer folders, and sends them in JSON format.\\
        When the game host presses the game start button, the first toonified image photo received in JSON format appears simultaneously on the screens of both the game host and the player. In order of arrival, players guess the answer, and when the game host presses the 'Check Answer' button, the correct answer text (character name) appears, and the Toonified image transforms into the original image. When the game host presses the 'Next Question' button, the next toonified image appears, and the game continues in the same manner.\\
        The AI model for the AI guessing game utilizes the StyleGAN2 model to toonify the given photo input. Initially, when a photo is received, the crop code processes it to ensure facial features are appropriately positioned in the photo. The cropped photo is then used to train a model that generates human facial images similar to the input photo using the pre-trained StyleGAN2 generation model. The newly generated model is combined with another pre-trained model, the toonify face model, to create a toonified image. The toonify image can be adjusted by modifying the alpha value to control the degree of toonification. The generated image is finally stored in AWS S3 in the form of a photo.

        
    \subsection{Geography Guessing Game}
        In the app, when a user requests a game, it retrieves values such as latitude and longitude of world-famous landmarks from the OpenAI API. Using the obtained values and the Google Street View API, it sends the URL of the Street View image of the famous landmark in JSON format.\\
        When the game host presses the game start button, the images of the famous landmarks received in JSON format simultaneously appear on the screens of both the game host and the player. By the order of pressing the answer button,, players guess the answer, and when the game host presses the 'Check Answer' button, the name of the landmark appears on the screen. When the game host presses the 'Next Question' button, the next landmark image appears, and the game continues in the same manner.

    \subsection{'Gather Up' Game}
        Using the NUGU AI Speaker, commands such as 'Start a game with 25 people.' can be given. The speaker sends the number '25' to the connected backend. The backend, using its own algorithm, returns a suitable number for the gathering game. The speaker then responds with something like '6 people gather up!' based on the algorithm's output.
        
    \subsection{App Setting Page}
        App setting page is a page where any kind of settings regarding the app can be modified, such as logging out. The main difference and function of the application’s setting is that it has buttons regarding the refreshing of the space code.\\
        When you press the "Code Refresh" button, the room's access code is randomly changed, and at the same time, all guests who were invited to the room are removed.\\
        Pressing the "Code Refresh" button causes all user's room access permissions to expire, and they are redirected to the room selection screen.

\section{Architecture Design}
    \subsection{Overall Architecture}
        Our service consists of four modules: front-end, back-end, database and AI
            \begin{figure}[htbp]

                \caption{Overall Architecture}
            \end{figure}
            The first module is the frontend that directly interacts with the user. The frontend of MC GPT is designed and developed using the React Native framework and Expo CLI. Users can access servers, databases, and artificial intelligence speakers through the app. The MC GPT app represents login, registration, room information, lighting and appliance information, game information, and account information through communication with the backend server via HTTP.\\
            In the lighting control feature, it is connected to ChatGPT to receive party lighting color information and implement the recommendation of party lighting colors for users. The game feature is implemented by connecting to the server using WebSocket, allowing multiple people to enjoy party games such as Disney games, geography games, and gather games in real-time. Among these, the gather game is connected to the artificial intelligence speaker when entering the game.\\
            React Hooks were utilized to manage local state and handle events. The Context API was used to access globally used states and values, allowing access from multiple screens. Through this, the app achieves consistent state management and data sharing, providing users with a more cohesive experience.\\

                \caption{Database Diagram}
            \end{figure}
            The second module is the backend that interacts with the database. The backend of MC GPT consists of a main server implemented in Spring, a second server implemented in Flask, a database implemented in PostgreSQL, and AWS S3 cloud storage. The main server has functionalities such as login and registration, creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of spaces and appliances, and real-time game progress. Various data generated through user interaction in the application is stored in the database through the main server. Among various games, the game utilizing the NUGU speaker goes through the algorithm of the main server, and the response is delivered to the speaker.\\
            The second server handles game and AI-related functions. For Disney games, the images generated by AI are uploaded to AWS S3. The server extracts 10 random links to these images from the storage and sends them to the frontend in link format. For geography games, the server receives latitude, longitude, and other values of famous tourist spots from the OpenAI API, uses them with the Google Street View API, and sends 10 links at a time to the frontend. The main server utilizes real-time communication features to progress the game using the links returned by the second server.\\
            All these backend components are built on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform. The main server and the second server are implemented on separate AWS Compute Cloud (Elastic EC2) instances, and the database is included in the EC2 instance of the main server.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
            
            The third module is the machine learning module for the AI image game. The primary functionality of the AI code is to process and manipulate photos for games on the game tab, creating generative image files and changing original photos to resemble Disney characters. Anything related to photos is processed using the StyleGAN2 model. To utilize the StyleGAN2 model, AI frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow are employed.\\
            The main script is the core component, establishing a connection to an AWS S3 bucket and performing tasks such as cropping, image inversion, and applying a toonify effect. It attempts to upload the resulting toonified image to the "MC-NUGU" S3 bucket.\\
            The projector defines an image inversion process using a pre-trained StyleGAN2-based generator. It iteratively adjusts a latent code to generate an image close to a given input face image. The result is saved to an output path, utilizing the LPIPS library for perceptual loss calculation.\\
            The toonify file defines an image toonification process using two pre-trained StyleGAN2-based generators. It blends intermediate outputs of corresponding layers in the generators to create a toonified image.\\
            The model defines a PyTorch implementation of a StyleGAN2-based generator (Generator class) and discriminator (Discriminator class) for image generation tasks. It includes functionalities for image blending, patch swapping, and merging, enhancing the generator's versatility.\\

    \subsection{Module 2: Back-End}
        \subsubsection{Purpose} 
            The backend server generates a response by interacting with the database when a request is made from the frontend. When data entered in the frontend is sent to the backend in JSON format, the backend processes the data by performing create, read, update, and delete operations on the database, and then generates a response in JSON format. The generated response is then delivered to the MC-GPT app.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            The backend server performs computations, communicates with NUGU, provides real-time gaming functionality, and interacts with the database. Additionally, it retrieves and returns appropriate responses to frontend requests by interacting with the database.\\

    \subsection{Module 3: Database}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}
            MC-GPT utilizes a significant amount of data, including user, space, home appliance, and game data. To ensure the operation of the service, this data needs to be stored not only in the user's mobile environment but also within the server's database. Given the close interrelation between these data sets, a relational database has been employed.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            When the server receives a request from the frontend, it interacts with the database. For user-initiated data creation, it processes using INSERT SQL; for data reading, it uses SELECT; for data updating, it employs UPDATE, and for data deletion, it utilizes DELETE SQL. Additionally, the server can leverage data statistics for further analysis and processing.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Component}
            \begin{itemize}

The member column is mapped to the id of the Member table, establishing a many-to-one relationship.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Guest Table\\
                The Guest table is designed for specifying the relationship between members and spaces. It includes columns such as id, member\_id, and home\_id. The id is the primary key, automatically generated as an ascending number. The member\_id establishes a many-to-one relationship with a single data entry in the Member table, and home\_id establishes a many-to-one relationship with a single data entry in the Home table.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Home Table\\
                The Home table stores information about spaces created by users. It includes columns such as id, name, code, owner, guests, and appliances. The id is the primary key, automatically generated as an ascending number. Name represents the space's name, code is a combination of a random 4-digit number and the ID of the member who created the space. Owner refers to the member who created the space and establishes a many-to-many relationship with the Member table. Guests is a list of members who have participated in the space, establishing a one-to-many relationship with the Guest table. Appliances is a list of appliances included in the space, establishing a one-to-many relationship with the Appliance table.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Appliance Table\\
                The Appliance table stores information about appliances. It includes columns such as id, serialNumber, name, isLight, type, locked, and home. The id is the primary key, automatically generated as an ascending number. SerialNumber stores the serial number of the appliance, isLight indicates whether the appliance includes a light, type automatically specifies the type of appliance, locked stores the lock setting of the appliance (True/False), and home indicates which space the appliance belongs to, establishing a many-to-one relationship with the Home table.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Home\_Game Table\\
                The Home\_Game table specifies the relationship between spaces and games. It includes columns such as id, home, game, mc, and realTimeUrl. The id is the primary key, automatically generated as an ascending number. Home is mapped to a data entry in the Home table, game is mapped to a data entry in the Game table, mc is mapped to the Member table, representing the game host, and realTimeUrl stores the real-time URL for game progress.
                \vspace{3mm}                
                \item Game Table\\
                The Game table stores information about AI mini-games. It includes columns such as id, name, gameType, and quizUrl. The id is the primary key, automatically generated as an ascending number. Name holds the game's name, gameType is an integer value specifying the type of game (e.g., app-based or speaker-based), and quizUrl stores the URL needed for the game progress, received from the server.
            \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Module 4: AI}
        \subsubsection{Purpose}
            The primary purpose of this AI module is to enhance and modify images specifically for a gaming environment, particularly within a game tab. The core focus is on machine learning, primarily the StyleGAN2 model, to process and manipulate photos. The main goal is to generate images that resemble Disney characters. This involves a combination of image processing techniques, such as cropping, inversion, and toonification, executed through a PyTorch implementation of the StyleGAN2-based generator and discriminator. The module is designed to integrate seamlessly with an AWS S3 bucket ("MC\_NUGU"), in charge of storing the processed images.\\
            \vspace{3mm}
        \subsubsection{Functionality}
            It begins by establishing a connection to the designated AWS S3 bucket, enabling seamless interaction with cloud storage. The core script orchestrates various image processing tasks, including cropping, image inversion, and applying a toonify effect, utilizing the StyleGAN2 model. The projector component iteratively adjusts latent codes to generate images resembling input face images, while the toonify file blends outputs of pre-trained StyleGAN2-based generators to create toonified images. The PyTorch implementation enhances the generative capabilities of the StyleGAN2 model with features like image blending and merging. Final step is uploading toonified images back to the AWS S3 bucket for integration into MC-GPT.\\

        \subsubsection{Component}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item .gitignore: File for preventing unnecessary files from committing to git\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item crop.py: File that crops images so that it can be used for the AI model. The key function is to align facial features and make the size of the image all equal.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item imgs folder: Folder containing images needed for the machine learning code. Consists of original file, cropped file and toonified file. Also the target directory for cropping and toonify. Images are saved and will be sent to aws s3 by the main.py.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item inversion\_codes folder: Folder containing images that are converted to a .pt file. This is also the target folder of projector.py. These files will be later used to generate images that can be used to toonify.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item main.py: Main python file that performs a series of image processing tasks using various functions imported from custom modules and external libraries. It starts by establishing a connection to an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). The script then crops an image, performs an image inversion, and applies a toonify effect to the cropped image. The resulting toonified image is saved locally. Finally, the script attempts to upload the toonified image to an S3 bucket named "MC\_NUGU" using the established connection.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item model.py: This code defines a PyTorch implementation of a StyleGAN2-based generator (`Generator` class) and discriminator (`Discriminator` class) for image generation tasks. The generator employs convolutional layers, noise injections, and skip connections to create diverse images based on input styles, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated images. The code also includes functionalities for image blending, patch swapping, and merging, enhancing the generator's versatility.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item Models folder: Folder containing pre-trained AI models. The two main models are the pre-trained face model and disney model.\\
                \item Notebook folder: Folder containing jupyter notebook files to show the pipeline of the process. It contains example images processing.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item projector.py: This file defines an image inversion process using a pre-trained StyleGAN2 based generator. The inversion is performed to find a latent code that generates an image close to a given input face image. The script initializes the generator, loads a pre-trained model, and defines a loss function combining perceptual, mean squared error (MSE), and Gaussian distribution losses. The inversion process iteratively adjusts the latent code using an Adam optimizer. The final inverted latent code and the generated image are saved to an output path. It also utilizes the LPIPS library for perceptual loss calculation and some utility functions for image processing. \\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item toonify.py: This file defines an image toonification process using two pre-trained StyleGAN2-based generators. The function `img\_toonify` takes a latent code and generates a toonified image, which is saved at the specified `save\_path`. The toonification is achieved by blending the intermediate outputs of corresponding layers in the two generators, controlled by the parameters `num\_swap` and `alpha`. The `early\_alpha` parameter controls the influence of the first generator, providing a gradual transition. The generators and latent codes are loaded from pre-trained models, and the result is saved as an image using Matplotlib.\\
                \vspace{3mm}
                \item util.py: This file encompasses a collection of utility functions tailored for working with PyTorch tensors and images, primarily within the context of StyleGAN2-based models. Key functionalities include loading pre-trained StyleGAN2 generators, processing inverted style codes, and visualizing images. The code facilitates the conversion between style vectors and lists, flattening spatial activations, and handling segmentation labels. Additionally, it offers functions for image manipulation, such as interpolation between style vectors, computing distances between tensors, and preparing bounding box visualizations. These utilities collectively serve to streamline tasks related to model loading, style code manipulation, and image visualization in the domain of generative adversarial networks, specifically StyleGAN2.\\
