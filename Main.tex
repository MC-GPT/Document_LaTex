\section{Introduction}

    \subsection{Motivation and Term Definition}
        In ‘MT’,  Many college students go these days, the ‘MC’ seems to have a hard time controlling the participants to host the party and run party games. If MC was someone other than a human, everyone could join the party instead of being divided into MC and participants. Also, a lot of game ideas beyond human limits could be generated. This human replacement MC idea could be applied to similar events and meetings like house parties, trending in some nations or periods like disease epidemic.\\
    	For a fun MT and eventful house party, not only party games but also Setting the party mood is one of the most important things. To do so, the home appliances in the room could conduct some special roles : the party mode. Setting the party mode with  smart-home appliances like LG and control them in the app. Control lightning of all the smart-home appliances to various colors suitable for the party concepts. Control the atmosphere, temperature, and homebrew in the best condition.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item MT :  Membership Training in Korea - A party lasts roughly two days and is considered a free-form training session, where students spend time socializing with peers in the same academic majors or clubs, often at a remote location.
            \item MC : Master of Ceremonies - the official host of the ceremonies, parties, events, or similar performances.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Problem Statements}
    \subsection{Solution}
    \subsection{Research on Any Relative Software}
    
    \section{Requirement Analysis}
    
    \subsection{Logging In}
    Logging in is required for users to have access to functions of the application. Without a login, it is impossible to use any of the functions of the app. If the application is not logged in, users can create their own account or login using an account they have created before. 
    
    \subsection{Creating Account}
    Users can sign up by setting a user id and password of their preference. Signing in requires input  of the given information in the sign up process such as userid, password and name.
    
    \subsection{Space Management}
    “Space” refers to any type of place where parties can be held and added to the software. Space management mainly focuses on space creation and space connection. Space creation means making a new space so that it can be used to link with electronics and made available for others to join. Space connection means gaining access to spaces via the code provided by owners. Each space has a unique code which can be shared with others and is required to access the functions provided. The code can be generated by creating a space in the application and request code generation on the settings tab. Also, Space management is separated into 2 types of classes;owners and users.\\ \\
    Space owner: Can generate random authentication codes for individual spaces. Also, it is possible to refresh the code which terminates the validity of the code for previous users, forcing them to lose access of the space.\\ \\
    Space user: A space user can gain access to spaces with the code provided by the owner. By having the code, the user also has access to the lighting and appliances pre-registered by the Space owner.

    \subsection{Status Dashboard}
    Users can view the status of the space upon logging into the software. It is the first page that a user will encounter upon connecting to a space. The dashboard acts as the main page of the application. It includes the name of the space, a simple announcement bar, data on space temperature and air quality. The name of the space is provided by owners, space temperature and air quality information comes from data on the related appliance. Also, it contains a music player where all users with access can add desired songs to a shared playlist. It is connected to whatever music output device that is present at the space, which means controlling the music player will have an effect on the sound of the space for everyone. 

    \subsection{Lighting Control}
    Provides controlling any hardware with lighting function. Users can change the brightness, color and effects of the lights using the software. It is not just for lighting devices but also for any kind of appliance that has a lighting function such as a NUGU candle or LG Mood-Up refrigerator Also, users can input any type of situation desired in natural language and the lighting will automatically change accordingly using AI. The input can be made by a input box using a keyboard or by requesting it in speech to an AI speaker. To help users that cannot make a decision for which lighting to use, there will be some preset requests available to execute.

    \subsection{Appliance Control}
    Provides control of any appliances that are synced with the software, such as changing the space temperature using an air conditioner, checking remaining beer amount on Homebrew,  setting the power of a air purifier. It will be functioning as a shared setting, which means any user can adjust the appliance. This will help make the environment of the party adequete for party instantly. Also, space owners can lock certain appliances, which results in prohibiting users from access to the locked appliance. Locking option can be activated by toggling a lock icon inside the appliance settings

    \subsection{Party Games}
    Users can play games from a list of games provided. There are 2 types of users in the process of the game, operator and participant. \\
    
    Game operator: Page consist of the answer of the game, a list to check the answering order, buttons for moving on to the next game and quitting the game for everyone\\
    
    Game participant: Page consist of the game question and a push button for confirming the answering order, which is in first-come-first-served basis.\\
    
    Currently there will be 3 games that will be serviced, however it is possible to include various games since the format is shared. The list of serviced games are as following.\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Image game: An AI model merges the face of two celebrities, the participants are asked to guess the celebrities based on the merged image.
        \item Landmark guessing game: The game receives the coordinates of famous landmarks around the world from OpenAI API. The data is sent to Google map API for a street view photo of the coordinate. Participants are required to guess the landmark from the street view photo.
        \item Gather up: Game operator first inputs the number of participants. NUGU speaker plays any music for about 10 seconds, stop the music and tell how many people to gather up. Then, participants gather up according to the given number and participants who could not gather up are eliminated. The process will be entirely conducted by the NUGU speaker, and the given number will be calculated by a pre-set algorithm

\section{Specification}
    \subsection{Loading Page}
        When a application communicates with servers, a delay is inevitable in the process. During the delay, it might show just a blank screen to users. To prevent users from getting a blank page, a loading screen will appear instead. This applies to all functions that require server communication including login, register, space creation, space connection and etc. \\
        This loading page UI is made by ‘skeleton’ from React Native. While receiving data from the server, components without received data shows that it is loading. In other words, while server is processing and receiving data after a http request has been made by the client. It can make a seamless and user friendly UI by using the loading screen.
    \subsection{Login Page}
        Logging in is required for users to have access to functions of the application. Without a login, it is impossible to use any of the functions of the app. If the application is not logged in, users can create their own account or login using an account they have created before. \\
        In a back-end point of view, The client receives an ID and password from the user and sends a request to the server when a button is pressed. On the server, it checks if there is ‘Member’ data in the DB and, if it exists, returns a security token known as JWT. The token expires after a certain time for security reasons and needs to be refreshed.  The client stores the JWT and includes it in the header of every request sent. \\
        In a front-end point of view, When a user clicks on the ID input field or the password input field, the input field's border is emphasized, and a keyboard appears. The screen moves up when the keyboard appears to ensure that it does not cover the screen.  If the user enters their ID and then presses the next button on the keyboard, it automatically transits to the password input field. The password displayed on the screen is encrypted while it is being entered.  Both the ID and password must be entered for the login button to become active. When the login button is pressed, it changes to a loading screen while the login process is executed on the server. After the login process is completed, the screen transitions to a page with a list of spaces. If the login fails, an Alert message is displayed, and the user remains on the login screen.
    \subsection{Register Page}
        Users can sign up by setting a user id and password of their preference. Signing in requires input  of the given information in the sign up process such as user id, password and name. There are boxes for input of the ID, name, nickname, password and password check. ID is the one that should be input in the login process, name refers to real name, nickname will be the name that will be shown to other users, password is also used in the login process and password check is used to double check if the user made their password as intended.\\
        Initially, on the client side, there are character limits and a check to ensure that the password and password check fields match. Once the client-side validation is successful, the client sends these fields to the server because client-side checks can be easily bypassed. On the server side, there is a secondary validation for each field to check for errors. If there are no errors, the data is saved to the Member database.  \\
        For the UI which is similar to the login process, clicking on an input field highlights it, brings up the keyboard, and ensures that the keyboard doesn't cover the screen. Even if the user doesn't directly click on an input field, pressing the next button will move to the next input field. The password and password confirm fields are displayed in an encrypted format. If any of the fields (name, nickname, ID, password, password confirm) are left empty or if the password and password confirm do not match, the sign-up button remains inactive. Only when all input fields are correctly filled does the sign-up button become active. Upon successful registration, the screen transits to the login page. If registration fails, an alert message is displayed, and the user remains on the registration screen.
    \subsection{Space List Page}
        “Space” refers to any type of place where parties can be held and these spaces can be added to the application. Page with the list of spaces is where users can outlook the spaces that are registered to the app. It is divided into two parts; first is ‘My Home ', which is the list of spaces that are owned by the user and registered to the application. Second is ‘Guest’ which has a list of spaces that the users are as guests by inputting the entrance code of spaces. Also there are buttons to activate pop-ups that allow users to add a new space or a pop-up for guest users to input the space code they have received.\\
        The JWT, sent in the header, is decoded to extract the user's ID. Using this ID, both the list of spaces owned by the member and the list of spaces the member has joined as a guest are retrieved.\\
        On the screen, the space list is displayed in two columns, with a "My Home" section and a "Guest" section, clearly distinguishing between the spaces the member owns and the spaces they have joined as a guest.  Clicking the "Create Space" button opens a pop-up screen for creating a space, and clicking the "Enter Code" button opens a pop-up screen for entering a code to join an existing space. Space owners will see their spacess listed under "My Home," while guests will see records of the spaces they have joined under the "Guest" section.  Clicking the "Log Out" button will transition the screen back to the initial login screen.
    \subsection{Space Registration Pop-Up}
        For a space to be ready to use in the application, it needs to be registered firsthand. The space registration pop-up can be accessed via the space list page. By activating the pop-up, space owners can input the name of the space and receive a invitation code for the space. After this process is valid, the new space should be added to the space list page.\\
        On the screen, the user inputs a room name, and a request is sent to the server to store it in the Home database. During this process, a room ID is generated along with a 4-digit random code that will be used for guest access. \\
        A pop-up screen for entering the space title is displayed. While this pop-up is open, the background of the room selection screen becomes opaque, and elements on the room selection screen cannot be interacted until the pop-up is closed. If the user clicks the "Back" button, they return to the space selection screen. If they enter a valid space title and click the "Confirm" button, a space is created, and the screen transitions to the Dashboard Page of the newly created space. If the space title is not entered correctly, a space creation failure alert is displayed, and the pop-up screen remains open.
    \subsection{Space Entrance Pop-Up}
        Space entrance pop-up is the first step for guest users to be able to gain allowance to spaces. This pop-up can be accessed from the space list page.  A space user can gain access to spaces with the code provided by the owner. By having the code, the user also has access to the lighting and appliances pre-registered by the Space owner. Upon inserting a valid space code, it will add a new space to the guest section of the space list page. Now users are allowed on the spaces.\\
        On the screen, when a code is entered, a request is sent to the server. The server searches the Home database for a matching entry. It also retrieves the user's ID from the JWT and fetches Member information. Once a match is found, the server stores the relationship between the Home and the Member in the Guest database, marking the user as a guest in that particular space.\\
        The process for entering a space using a code is similar to the space creation pop-up. After entering a valid code and clicking the "Confirm" button, the user enters the corresponding space, and the initial page, the Dashboard Page, is displayed. If the code is not entered correctly, an alert message is shown, prompting the user to re-enter the code, and the pop-up screen remains open.
    \subsection{Dashboard (Main Page)}
        The Dashboard page is the main page that is first shown to users when entering a space. The main function of the dashboard page is showing an overview of the ongoing party. To help this objective, users can control the music playing from an audio device connected to the application, if there is any. Also there is a shared playlist where party participants can add desired songs to the list. In addition, there are information on the status of the space such as room temperature and air quality. These data can be sourced from the appliances that are connected to the space. Finally at the top there is the name of the space, exit space button, space code and a brief announcement bar. Name and code for the space is based on the data from the database and exiting button leads users back to the space list page. For the announcement bar, any user can post up to 25 characters and all users in the space can see the announcement.\\
        It's a screen composed of tabs, and from the user's perspective, it's not ideal to send requests every time you switch tabs, as it can cause delays. Therefore, as soon as you enter this screen, all the data for the space, including lighting and appliance lists, as well as the game list, is fetched all at once. This data is stored in a context for later use.\\        
        Announcements are displayed as text animations that move from the left side of the screen to the right side, taking 13 seconds. There's a button to return to the room selection screen, allowing users to navigate back. On the screen, the album cover of the music currently playing on the AI speaker is displayed, along with music playback options and playlists.
